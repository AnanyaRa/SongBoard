# SongBoard
SongBoard: Like a moodboard, but with music! a tool where users can get song recommendations to match their indicated mood for the day. Made using React and the Spotify API.

The overall idea: mood indicated by color (typical associations), recommending music based on that to help with mood. info for user: can start with just clicking a color, and then use spotify API to generate recommendations based on a certain category that is associated with the mood/color. recommend that song and display to user. later versions of software can have user's country info, use spotify profile info to make more personalized recs based on what kind of music they may already listen to. have a detailed account log where they can have a running table listing their previous moods for other days and the musc recommended to them on those days. could maybe also add the recommended music to a running spotify playlist for that user that is periodically updated?
